                 Hi!! My name is Allegra Oledibe and one of my favorite things to do is travel. Over the years I've gotten 
                    the ooportunity to travel both domestically (withing the United States) and internationally (outside of 
                    the United States) to many different places. The reason why I love traveling is because I get to experience
                    someone else's culture and languange and becasue traveling takes me out of my comfort zone; it inspires me to see, 
                    try, and taste new things!
